        "content": "您的翻译已经非常不错了，但是有一些地方还需要改进。以下是我的建议：\n\n1. \"unique\"这个词在中文里面翻译成“有特色”比较恰当，但是在英文里面，更常用的表达是“distinctive”或者“unusual”。\n2. \"antiques and artworks\"可以改成“antiques and art pieces”，这样更符合英文的表达。\n3. “吃得很满足”可以改成“we were all very satisfied with the meal”。\n4. \"However, the prices in the restaurant are a bit expensive, and each of us spent a lot of money.\"这句话可以改成“However, the prices in the restaurant were a bit steep, and we all ended up spending a lot of money.”。\n\n所以，完整的英文翻译如下：\n\nYesterday, my friend and I went to a newly opened restaurant.
